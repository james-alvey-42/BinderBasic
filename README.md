# Binder Basics

![binder-logo](img/binder.png)

This is a very basic example of how to use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to easily host projects that have dependencies in languages such as Python and Julia. To launch the virtual environment either click on the badge above or follow [this link](https://mybinder.org/). For examples of other Binder projects see [here](https://github.com/binder-examples).

## Code Structure

All that is really required to host a Binder repository is an `environment.yml` file of the type created in a conda environment.
